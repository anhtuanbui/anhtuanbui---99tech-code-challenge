Inefficiencies and anti-patterns:  

1. Unnecessary re-renders:

- The `useWalletBalances` and usePrices hooks are called on every render, potentially causing unnecessary re-renders if their values change frequently.


2. Inefficient filtering and sorting:

- The `sortedBalances` useMemo hook performs filtering and sorting on every render, even if balances hasn't changed.
- The `getPriority` function is called multiple times for the same blockchain in both filter and sort operations.


3. Unused computed values:

- `formattedBalances` is computed but never used in the component.


4. Inconsistent use of formatted balances:

- `sortedBalances` is used to create rows instead of formattedBalances.


5. Potential performance issue with `toFixed()`:

- Using `toFixed()` without specifying decimal places can lead to unexpected results and potential performance issues for large numbers.


6. Inefficient price lookup:

- The `usdValue` is calculated for each row, potentially causing multiple lookups in the prices object.


7. Missing error handling:

- There's no handling for cases where `prices[balance.currency]` might be `undefined`.


8. Use of `index` as key in list rendering:

- Using array `index` as a key for React list items can lead to performance issues and bugs with dynamic lists.


9. Unnecessary spread operator:

- The `...rest` spread is used on a div element, which might spread unnecessary props.


10. Lack of memoization for child components:

- The `WalletRow` component is not memoized, which could lead to unnecessary re-renders.
