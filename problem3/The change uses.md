This refactored version addresses the identified issues by:

1. Using useMemo and useCallback to optimize performance.
2. Combining filtering, sorting, and formatting into a single operation.
3. Pre-calculating USD values to avoid multiple price lookups.
4. Using a more specific key for list items.
5. Memoizing the WalletRow component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
6. Removing unused computations and variables.
7. Adding basic error handling for price lookups.
8. Using a constant object for blockchain priorities to improve readability and performance.
